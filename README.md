# mobilki

A academic project for Introduction to Mobile Systems.
Written in Flutter with Firebase and Google API.

The application aims to provide an environment to search for people who would like to spend time actively in the form of a team game - basketball.
The target audience is people who are unable to find people to spend their free time in this way on a daily basis.
We offer the opportunity to create and subscribe to public events created by other users. In addition, users have the option to further associate with other users by creating teams that, on their own, can also organize their own private events.
